# PDF Accessibility Checker

A modern, client-side web tool for checking the accessibility of PDF documents in batch. Upload one or more PDF files and instantly see if their text is selectable and readable â€” all directly in your browser, with no server upload required. Results are shown with document previews, clear status indicators, and easy navigation.

## Features

- **Batch upload PDF files:** Select one or more PDFs from your computer. Only `.pdf` files are accepted.
- **Client-side analysis:** All processing happens in your browser; no files are uploaded or stored elsewhere.
- **Accessibility check:** The tool analyzes each PDF to verify if it contains selectable and readable text (not just images or corrupted content).
- **Visual previews:** See a thumbnail of the first page for each PDF, or a placeholder if no preview is available.
- **Clear results table:** Each document is marked as accessible (green lamp) or not accessible (red lamp), along with its file name and preview.

## What is "PDF Accessibility"?

In this tool, a PDF is considered **accessible** if:
- The document contains at least one page with selectable text (not just scanned images).
- The extracted text is readable (i.e., not corrupted or composed of random/garbled characters).

A PDF is **not accessible** if:
- It only contains scanned images (no selectable text).
- Its text is damaged or unreadable when copied/pasted.
- It is encrypted, protected, or fails to load.
